// Follow the steps below to create a **while** loop that TOTALS the numbers from 1 to 100

// 1) create a variable to represent the current number

// 2) create a variable to represent the current total

// 3) write a while loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 100


// Now using the same variables you created in steps 1 and 2, create a **for** loops that TOTALS the numbers from 1 to 100

// 1) write a for loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 100
 let currentNum = 1;

 for (let currentNum= 1; currentNum <=100; currentNum++) {
